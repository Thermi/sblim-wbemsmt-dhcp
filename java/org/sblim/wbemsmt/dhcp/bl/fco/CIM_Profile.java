 * Description: Profile specifies a general collection of Settings/SettingData that are logically grouped together. Note that the CIM_Profile class uses simplified naming/identity and collection algorithms, as compared to CIM_Configuration. The settings are 'collected' into the Profile using the MemberOfCollection association. Note that a Profile obtains its setting data and other necessary information from collected Setting/SettingData instances, and by the definition of additional properties in subclasses. One example of a Profile is to define the collection of settings for a particular person. Another is to define the collection of settings appropriate when initializing a system. 
 * 
 * Profile is tied to a ManagedElement using the ElementProfile association. The ManagedElement provides context for the Profile, and the settings collected by Profile SHOULD be settings of the associated ManagedElement. Note that a ManagedElement MAY NOT exist when the Profile is instantiated. This is true when the Profile is used in the creation of the real world entity represented by (and then instantiated in) the ManagedElement.
