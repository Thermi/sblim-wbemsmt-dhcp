  * Description: CIM_SettingData is used to represent configuration and and operational parameters for CIM_ManagedElement instances. There are a number of different uses of CIM_SettingData supported in the model today. Additional uses may be defined in the future.
  * Instances of CIM_SettingData may represent Aspects of a CIM_ManagedElement instance. This is modeled using the CIM_SettingsDefineState association. CIM_SettingData may be used to define capabilities when associated to an instance of CIM_Capabilities through the CIM_SettingsDefineCapabilities association. 
  * Instances of CIM_SettingData may represent different types of configurations for a CIM_ManagedElement, including persistent configurations, in progress configuration changes, or requested configurations. The CIM_ElementSettingData association is used to model the relationship between a CIM_SettingData instance and the CIM_ManagedElement for which it is a configuration. 
  * When an instance of CIM_SettingData represents a configuration, the current operational values for the parameters of the element are reflected by properties in the Element itself or by properties in its associations. These properties do not have to be the same values that are present in the SettingData object. For example, a modem might have a SettingData baud rate of 56Kb/sec but be operating at 19.2Kb/sec. 
  * Note: The CIM_SettingData class is very similar to CIM_Setting, yet both classes are present in the model because many implementations have successfully used CIM_Setting. However, issues have arisen that could not be resolved without defining a new class. Therefore, until a new major release occurs, both classes will exist in the model. Refer to the Core White Paper for additional information. SettingData instances can be aggregated together into higher- level SettingData objects using ConcreteComponent associations.

     * @param resultClass This string MUST either contain a valid CIM Class name or be null. It filters the Objects returned to contain only the Objects of this Class name or one of its subclasses. The resultClass should be CIM_ASSOCIATOR_CLASS_NAME_CIM_ELEMENTSETTINGDATA or a subclass 
     * @param role This string MUST either contain a valid Property name or be null. It filters the Objects returned to contain only Objects associated to the source Object via an Association class in which the source Object plays the specified role. (i.e. the Property name in the Association class that refers to the source Object matches this value) If "Antecedent" is specified, then only Associations in which the source Object is the "Antecedent" reference are examined.
     * @param resultRole This string MUST either contain a valid Property name or be null. It filters the Objects returned to contain only Objects associated to the source Object via an Association class in which the Object returned plays the specified role. (i.e. the Property name in the Association class that refers to the Object returned matches this value) If "Dependent" is specified, then only Associations in which the Object returned is the "Dependent" reference are examined. 
     * @param includeQualifiers If true, all Qualifiers for each Object (including Qualifiers on the Object and on any returned Properties) MUST be included in the Objects returned. If false, no Qualifiers are present in each Object returned.
     * @param includeClassOrigin If true, the CLASSORIGIN attribute will be present on all appropriate elements in the Objects returned. If false, no CLASSORIGIN attributes are present in the Objects returned. CLASSORIGIN is attached to an element (properties, methods, references) to indicate the class in which it was first defined.
     * @param propertyList An array of property names used to filter what is contained in the Objects returned. Each CIMClass or CIMInstance returned only contains elements for the properties of the names specified. Duplicate and invalid property names are ignored and the request is otherwise processed normally. An empty array indicates that no properties should be included in the Objects returned. A null value indicates that all properties should be contained in the Objects returned. NOTE: Properties should not be specified in this parameter unless a non-null value is specified in the resultClass  parameter.
